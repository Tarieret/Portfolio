## Projects
**Financial Time-Series Forecasting:
NVIDIA Case Study**
This project establishes a time series forecasting baseline for NVIDIA (NVDA) stock using the classical ARIMA model and MACD technical indicator. The analysis highlights a critical model failure to capture the sudden, non-linear price acceleration driven by the GenerativeÂ AI boom and record earnings, demonstrating the inadequacy of linear models for modern, event-driven financial markets.

**Key Skills:** Python, Time Series Analysis, ARIMA Modeling, MACD, MAE/RMSE, Root Cause Analysis.
