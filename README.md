## Projects
**ARIMA Baseline & Failure Analysis of NVDA Stock**
This project establishes a time series forecasting baseline for NVIDIA (NVDA) stock using the classical ARIMA model and MACD technical indicator. The analysis highlights a critical model failure to capture the sudden, non-linear price acceleration driven by the GenerativeÂ AI boom and record earnings, demonstrating the inadequacy of linear models for modern, event-driven financial markets.

**Key Skills:** Python, Time Series Analysis, ARIMA Modeling, MACD, MAE/RMSE, Root Cause Analysis.

 **Spatial Clustering of Air Pollution in NYC**
 
This project analyzes NYC air quality data (PM2.5 & NO2) using K-means & hierarchical clustering to identify pollution patterns. It reveals areas with high concentrations and highlights the strengths of each clustering method for environmental data analysis.

**Key Skills:** Python, Clustering, K-means, Heirarchichal clustering

 **Student Information System Database Design**

This project designed and implemented a relational database schema for a student information system. The schema efficiently manages data related to students, courses, instructors, sections, and enrollments. It incorporates normalization principles, data integrity constraints, and best practices for data handling. The design ensures efficient data storage, retrieval, and minimizes redundancy.

**Key Technologies:**
MySQL (Database Management System)
Entity-Relationship Modeling
SQL
